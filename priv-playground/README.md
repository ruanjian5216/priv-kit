# priv-playground

An unpublished UI demonstration host under `priv.kit.playground`. It consumes `:priv-ui` on
Desktop/JVM and Browser/WasmJS. Android integration remains in `:priv-sample`.

`commonMain` provides the HyperUI theme and renders `PrivilegePreviewScaffold()`. The Desktop
entry point creates a resizable window. The Wasm entry point exports `renderPrivilegePlayground`,
which accepts a host element, resource URL resolver, theme, `useLegacyPackaging`, and `adbRestricted`. The website owns the element lifecycle.
Root, Wireless ADB, static TCP, manual startup, and external authorization use an in-memory simulation.
Operations default to success, pairing accepts any six digits, and confirmation/cancellation dialogs
drive the same shared page components. No privileged runtime, networking, or system changes occur.
Copy buttons copy sample text to the host clipboard. Closing the page or window discards the session.

Run the desktop app:

```shell
./gradlew :priv-playground:run
```

Run the website from the repository root:

```shell
pnpm dev
```

Set the `PRIV_KIT_SKIP_ANDROID` environment variable to build or run the website without an
Android SDK or NDK. Only its presence matters; its value is ignored.
This mode loads only `:priv-ui` and `:priv-playground` and disables the UI module's Android
target. Java is still required for Gradle. The website workflow enables this mode; leave
the variable unset for Android builds and publishing.

Open `/playground/` or `/zh/playground/`. The Vue page provides
language, appearance, `useLegacyPackaging`, and ADB permission restriction controls outside the canvas. `priv-playground/scripts/build-playground.ts` builds the Wasm executable and assembles
the entry module, Wasm, Skiko, and Compose resources in the ignored `priv-playground/dist` directory.
The private workspace package exposes `renderPrivilegePlayground(container, dark, useLegacyPackaging, adbRestricted)` with its resource resolver
already configured. The Vue page loads it with `import('@priv-kit/playground')`; Vite bundles its dependencies and
fingerprints the Wasm, font, and string resources into `priv-website/.vitepress/dist/assets`.
The `@priv-kit/playground/wasm-assets` export contains build-time Wasm sizes without loading the runtime.
The Vue loading overlay tracks streamed Wasm response bytes to show download progress, then switches
to startup status. Fetch tracking is removed on readiness, failure, or unmount.
Thin localized Markdown pages mount the component through `ClientOnly` with `layout: false`.
VitePress handles routing and the single website build; no separate Vite build or dev server is needed.
The route selects the UI language, and appearance follows the website theme. Leaving the page
clears the Compose host and restores the browser language settings used by Compose resources.
The Wasm mount function returns an options updater, so switching the theme or packaging preserves simulation data.
The ADB restriction switch defaults to on and immediately updates the warning and permission list
for simulated Shell connections, including manual startup. It also applies to subsequent connections;
Root connections remain unrestricted. Toggling it preserves the current connection and session.
The manual command uses a session-local installation path with two URL-safe Base64 tokens encoding 16 random bytes each
and the fixed package name `priv.kit.sample`. Packaging defaults to `true` (extracted ARM64 library); `false`
shows the `linker64` command for the library inside `base.apk`. Switching formats retains the installation path.
Changing the language opens a new localized page session.
Build the package with `pnpm --filter @priv-kit/playground build:wasm` before importing it outside the website scripts.
No npm or Maven artifact is published for this module.

The playground bundles Noto Sans SC from the Google Fonts repository to render Chinese in Wasm.
Its SIL Open Font License is included under `src/commonMain/composeResources/files/NotoSansSC-OFL.txt`.
The font is demonstration-host data and is not shipped in `priv-ui`.
While copying Gradle resources, the browser build reads the source font and writes its subset
directly into `dist`, retaining all ASCII code points
(`U+0000–U+007F`) and every character found in repository `.kt` and `.xml` files.
Each file contributes only its unique non-ASCII characters; ASCII is seeded once globally.
Git's standard ignore rules apply, including nested `.gitignore` files; untracked source files
are included, while ignored files are excluded even when tracked. Source text is scanned
literally, without decoding Kotlin escapes or XML entities. Characters absent from the original
font cannot be added by subsetting, and arbitrary user input may still need font fallback.
Run `pnpm --filter @priv-kit/playground check` to check the TypeScript tooling and scan behavior.

The preview also accepts `batteryOptimizationExempt` and `localNetworkPermissionGranted`
(default `true`). Turning either off shows its ADB prompt card; ADB operations
remain available without local network permission. Simulated permission requests notify the host through
`onPermissionsChanged`, keeping the website switches in sync without restarting the session.
